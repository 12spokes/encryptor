= Encryptor

A simple wrapper for the standard ruby OpenSSL library

Used by http://github.com/shuber/attr_encrypted to easily encrypt/decrypt attributes in any class


== Installation

  gem install encryptor


== Usage

  secret_key = Digest::SHA256.hexdigest('a secret key')
  encrypted_value = Encryptor.encrypt(:value => 'some string to encrypt', :key => secret_key) # '������{)��q�ށ�ܣ��q���Au/�ޜP'
  decrypted_value = Encryptor.decrypt(:value => encrypted_value, :key => secret_key) # 'some string to encrypt'

You may also pass the <tt>:iv</tt> and <tt>:algorithm</tt> options but they are not required. If an algorithm is not specified, the Encryptor uses
the algorithm found at <tt>Encryptor.default_options[:algorithm]</tt> which is <tt>aes-256-cbc</tt> by default. You can change the default options 
by overwriting or merging this attribute:

  Encryptor.default_options.merge!(:algorithm => 'bf', :key => 'some default secret key')

Run <tt>openssl list-cipher-commands</tt> in your terminal to view a list all cipher algorithms that are supported on your platform.

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but
   bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
